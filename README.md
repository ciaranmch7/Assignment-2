This is a side scrolling spaceship game in which you take control of a spaceship and have to dodge enemy space ships. This was was completeted using processing through eclipse.


I completed this project by myself. I came up with the idea for a spaceship side scroller as I have always been a fan of sci-fi.
I wanted to make something I knew I was capabale of making and that would be a complete project. I wrote the code all by myself and I planned how I would complete this project aswell. I alos commited each change to my git repository. Some of the commits are different from the finished project as I had trouble along the way of completing the project.
